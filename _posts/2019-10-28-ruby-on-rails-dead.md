I am starting a new job search, so I've been looking at lots of listings lately. (Yes, there is a sequel to [Why I didn‚Äôt apply to your job]({% post_url /2018-12-19-why-i-didnt-apply %}) in the works, and it‚Äôs going to be juicy. üòÜ)

One thing I‚Äôve been looking into is what technologies are popular with the companies I‚Äôm interested in. So, when I find a job that appeals to me, I paste it into a spreadsheet along with the tech stack, if they listed it. Then I tallied up all of the technologies mentioned, to see what's the most popular. I am doing this partly out of pure curiosity, and partly to help me decide where to direct my efforts in learning and building portfolio projects.

Results are below, in order of popularity. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of companies who said they use a technology. I only included the ones that got at least 4 mentions.

1. Ruby/Rails (16)
2. React (15)
3. Javascript (8)
4. Postgres (8)
5. Go (6)
6. AWS (6)
7. MySQL (5)
8. Redis (5)
9. Python (5)
10. Node (5)
11. Redux (4)
12. Typescript (4)

A few caveats:

* These results are super biased. It‚Äôs companies I‚Äôm interested in, and I like Ruby on Rails, so seeing it listed made me somewhat more likely to add a company to my spreadsheet.
* However, technologies are not the main thing my level of interest is based on. Location, culture, and other factors are more important. The real bias here is that I‚Äôm focusing on small-but-not-too-small companies in the Bay Area that are looking for full stack web developers with approximately my level of experience, don't have obvious D&I or ethical problems, and follow engineering practices I believe in like TDD and pair programming. Mostly product companies, plus 1 or 2 consultancies.
* This is based on what companies thought was important enough to include in their job ad, not necessarily everything they use. My guess is more companies are using AWS and Redux, for example, than indicated here.
* Yes, React has more points than Javascript. Again, it‚Äôs based on what companies wrote in their ads, so if they didn‚Äôt use the word ‚ÄúJavascript‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt give it a point.

Looks like Ruby on Rails is going strong! Lots of these companies are pretty new startups, too. I don't think they all chose Rails back when it was the hot new thing&mdash;they made the choice to use Rails fairly recently.
