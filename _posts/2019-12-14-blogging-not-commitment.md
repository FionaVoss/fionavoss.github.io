A while ago I came across Emily Nakashima’s blog [Honkathon](https://honkathon.com/post/), and there were two things that made an impression on me. The first was her post about [sunset testing](https://honkathon.com/2014-07-25-sunset-testing-for-short-lived-code/). The second was her posting frequency. Six posts in six years. I was impressed.

I’m not kidding. How many bloggers who blog that infrequently are that consistent? Honkathon is not abandoned; the latest two posts are from this year. How many bloggers who wrote one single post in the year they started blogging have kept at it for six years, however infrequently?

I’ve seen people who said the reason they haven’t started a blog is because they know they’d abandon it and feel guilty. I’ve heard people dismiss the very idea of blogging, saying that it serves no purpose except to make bloggers feel guilty for not posting often enough. This is a shame, because it means there are people with thoughts they want to share with the world who aren’t sharing them!

A blog may feel like your baby, but it’s not an actual baby. There’s no set schedule you have to feed it on. If you have one thing you want to share with the world, that’s enough to start a blog with. You can write a little note saying you’re not committed to posting with any particular frequency if it makes you feel better, but you don’t have to.

Why make it a blog, and not just a web page? Because if you have one thing you want to share with the world right now, chances are, eventually you’ll have another one, even if it takes a year or two. And next time, if you’ve already gone through the whole process of getting a blog online, it will be that much easier to publish your second post, and you'll have a nice index of both your posts without any extra work. (Also, if you’re only posting once a year or so, it’s really handy for your readers if you have an RSS feed they can subscribe to.)

There’s no need to feel guilty about blogging infrequently, so if you’ve got something to say, don’t let that stop you!
