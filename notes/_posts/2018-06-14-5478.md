[Avdi Grimm on the Ruby community](https://avdi.codes/rubyconf-2017/):

>But it is this environment of trust and safety that has led, I think, to a community that threw conferences featuring talks about empathy, and depression, and burnout, and activism and other squishy-but-scary topics. And that did it long before most of the rest of the software industry got up the nerve to talk about those things in public.

>And it&#39;s why I have heard from so many people: “I mostly code in $other_lang, but I come to Ruby events for the community”.
