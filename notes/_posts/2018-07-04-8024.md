Today was fun in a wanting to pull my hair out kind of way. Spent a couple hours debugging a problem that only happened in Firefox on Mac, but not every Mac. We ended up deciding it wasn&#39;t important enough to spend any more time fixing. 

Learned some stuff about online privacy though: see Firefox&#39;s explanation of how [HTTP referrers can leak sensitive data](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/31/preventing-data-leaks-by-stripping-path-information-in-http-referrers/) and their writeup of a study they did to see [if they could improve privacy without breaking the web](https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2018/01/26/improving-privacy-without-breaking-the-web/).
