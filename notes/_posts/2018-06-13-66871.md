Anil Dash says [it would be a bad idea for Twitter to allow the editing of Tweets](https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1006708333846384640), and I don&#39;t disagree. It would lead to all sorts of problems if they allowed this for the Nazis, the harassers, and the President. But what about the rest of us who just want to be able to fix our typos? Why are we putting up with a platform where such a basic feature as *editing your own posts* is deeply problematic?

That&#39;s a rhetorical question; I know why I&#39;m on Twitter. It&#39;s because, in the web dev community, Twitter is the de facto way of keeping in touch with professional friends and acquaintances. If I quit Twitter, I&#39;ll lose my connection to many people I want to stay connected with. But I would like to see the community move toward better platforms.
