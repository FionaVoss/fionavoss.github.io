Unanticipated benefit to [microblogging on my own site](http://fionavoss.blog/2018/04/01/microblogging-in-jekyll) and syndicating to Twitter, versus just posting in Twitter: posting is separated from consumption. When I have something on my mind, I can publish it without getting sucked into checking my feed &amp; notifications.

To post from a browser, I use [Quill](https://quill.p3k.io/), which only has a posting interface. On my phone, I use the Micro.blog app, which does have a feed, but is much less of a time-waster than Twitter for me, thanks to its non-manipulative UI.

I&#39;ve removed the Twitter app from my phone, but I can still post from my phone if I want to, without the constant temptation to check my feed.
