Working on a project right now where "sprinkles of JavaScript" is absolutely the right approach. In fact, it is for most of my work. I'm using jQuery, but really intrigued by [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org). Loved [the Changelog's interview with DHH about it](https://changelog.com/podcast/286) for a look into the motivations and process behind creating it.
