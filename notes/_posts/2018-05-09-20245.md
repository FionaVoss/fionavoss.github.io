I really like how there’s no character limit on replies on Micro.blog. (I’m sure there is one, but it’s large enough that I’ve never noticed it.) For some reason on Twitter I get more frustrated by the character limits on replies than on top-level posts. So to me it’s cool that Micro.blog truncates posts but not replies. I know Manton has said it’s technically a bug, but I hope it doesn’t change.
