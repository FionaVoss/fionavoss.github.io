A writer reflects on how [italicizing foreign words can be a form of “othering”](http://languagehat.com/on-italicizing-words/). My take: what even is a foreign word in English? Why don’t we italicize “garage”, or “armadillo”? Italics don’t mark a word as foreign, they mark it as a new arrival. But what’s a new arrival to me may not be a new arrival to you.
