Sarah Mei says [she writes tweet storms instead of blog posts because the realtime feedback she gets makes her writing better](https://medium.com/@sarahmei/why-i-tweetstorm-instead-of-blog-dd77621596d9). Not being Twitter famous, it didn&#39;t even occur to me that that&#39;s a possibility. I&#39;m still pro-blog and anti-tweet-storm, but glad to hear her perspective.
