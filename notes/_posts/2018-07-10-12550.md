TIL that Rails&#39;s inflector class [is officially frozen, as a safety measure](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/inflections.rb):

```ruby
#--
# Defines the standard inflection rules. These are the starting point for
# new projects and are not considered complete. The current set of inflection
# rules is frozen. This means, we do not change them to become more complete.
# This is a safety measure to keep existing applications from breaking.
#++
```
