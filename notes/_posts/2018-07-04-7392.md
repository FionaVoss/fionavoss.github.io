[The impact of the â€˜openâ€™ workspace on human collaboration](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239) ðŸ”—

> Contrary to common belief, the volume of face-to-face interaction decreased significantly (approx. 70%) in both cases, with an associated increase in electronic interaction. In short, rather than prompting increasingly vibrant face-to-face collaboration, open architecture appeared to trigger a natural human response to socially withdraw from officemates and interact instead over email and IM.

This matches my own experience. I share an office with three other people and it&#39;s pretty quiet, but we do talk *sometimes*. When I had to move to an open space area for two weeks during some construction, I was shocked at how silent it was! They didn&#39;t even say &quot;Good morning&quot; to each other!
