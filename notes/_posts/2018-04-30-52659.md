This part of [Stack Overflow’s recent blog post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/) applies to the software “craftsmanship” discussion:

“Well, the nice thing about problems that relate to how people feel is that finding the truth is easy. Feelings have no “technically correct.” They’re just what the feeler is telling you.”

Even if *you* think “craftsman” is gender-neutral, when others tell you they think it’s exclusionary, it’s time to find an alternative word.
