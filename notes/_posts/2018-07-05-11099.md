[How to read](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/) ðŸ”—

The first sentence caught my eye because I have this problem too:

Five years ago I realized that I remembered almost nothing about most books that I read.

Robert Heaton goes on to describe how began taking notes and writing summaries to help him remember what it reads.

It all sounded like a lot of work for pleasure reading, so I wrote it off at first, but the promise of remembering more of what I read is too enticing. So, I&#39;ve started highlighting as I read my current book ([*The Prodigal Tongue* by Lynne Murphy](https://theprodigaltongue.com/)), something I never do. I&#39;m highlighting bits that sum up each section, as well as details I find interesting. Thinking of writing a blog post about it when I&#39;m done. We&#39;ll see.
