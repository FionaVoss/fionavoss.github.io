The same Hebrew phrase from which we get &quot;coat of many colors&quot; [has been interpreted by various translators to mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_many_colors): 
* &quot;coat with long sleeves&quot;
* &quot;long coat with stripes&quot;
* &quot;a richly ornamented robe&quot;.
* &quot;a coat reaching to his feet&quot; 
* &quot;an ornamented tunic&quot;
* &quot;a silk robe&quot;
* &quot;a fine woolen cloak&quot;
