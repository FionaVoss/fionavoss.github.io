Learned about the curb cut effect from [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/): itâ€™s when a design element designed to help a particular group of people (wheelchair users) turns out to benefit a broader range of people than anticipated (people using strollers, walkers, rolling suitcases, etc.). Applicable to many disciplines, including software development.
