[This review](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21548-off-the-wall/) sums up exactly why *Off the Wall* is my favorite Michael Jackson album.

Side note: wedding DJs should really make &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot; the default last song of the night rather than &quot;Closing Time&quot; or whatever they play these days.
