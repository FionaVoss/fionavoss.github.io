As much as I love Jekyll, I think my blog may be starting to outgrow it. I started using tags heavily and now I’m feeling the need for a relational database. I was kind of sad about it at first, but now I’m excited. I think I’ll likely roll my own CMS in Rails, and it will be fun to have a Rails project that’s all mine.
