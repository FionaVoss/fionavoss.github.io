People who say San Diego doesnâ€™t have seasons are mistaken. We have many seasons:

1. Nice but it rains sometimes. 
2. Nice but cloudy in the morning. 
3. [Parrots!](http://www.sdnews.com/view/full_story/21895985/article-Noisy--but-beautifully-exotic-wild-parrots-call-San-Diego-home-?instance=most_popular1)
3. Nice but a bit too hot in the middle of the day. 
4. HOT. 
5. Fires. 
5. Nice but the sun sets too early.
