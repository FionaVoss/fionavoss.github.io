Today&#39;s tweak to my website: previously, [my homepage](http://fionavoss.blog/) was a chronological list of articles. Now it&#39;s a list of pages, and the article list is on [a separate page](http://fionavoss.blog/articles/). Trying to make everything easier to find, and explain the difference between &quot;notes&quot; and &quot;articles&quot;.
