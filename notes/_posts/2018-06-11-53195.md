[Kyle Shevlin’s answer to, “Do you need to know math to be a programmer?”](https://twitter.com/kyleshevlin/status/1005685351287963648?s=21)

> You don’t need math, you need propositional logic. Most people learn this indirectly through math. If we start teaching propositional logic formally to more students, then people would realize math is not the true prerequisite to programming. This opens the field to more people.
