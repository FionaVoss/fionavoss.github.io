It won&#39;t work in all situations, but I like [this prescription for code ownership](https://medium.com/@ard_adam/code-reviews-are-broken-here-is-how-to-fix-them-c34497f1721b): each repo has one owner, who is responsible for reviewing all changes. The owner&#39;s own changes don&#39;t need to be reviewed, since no one knows the code better than them.
