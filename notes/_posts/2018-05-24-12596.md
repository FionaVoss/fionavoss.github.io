[This report from Deloitte about covering in the workplace](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/about-deloitte/us-inclusion-uncovering-talent-paper.pdf) is a must-read. Covering is when people hide or downplay certain aspects of their identity because they feel pressure to do so. Examples of covering:

1. When a mother avoids mentioning her children so that people don&#39;t question her dedication to her job.
2. When a black woman feels she must straighten her hair for work to avoid unwanted comments.
3. When a non-drinker avoids social events so they won&#39;t get called out for not drinking alcohol.

I knew about these pressures, but I did not know the term &quot;covering&quot;. Knowing a word that encompasses all of these scenarios is illuminating, because it shows how they are similar.
