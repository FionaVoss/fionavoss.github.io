The [IndieWeb Summit RSVP list](https://2018.indieweb.org/#rsvps) is giving me major FOMO. Hopefully next year I&#39;ll be able to go and meet everyone! Small conference organizers, I think a public RSVP list may be a super effective way to promote your event. Of course, attendees can RSVP privately if they prefer.
