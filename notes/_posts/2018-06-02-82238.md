Experimenting with the [Send to Kindle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-to-kindle-for-google/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea) Chrome extension for saving articles and blog posts to my Kindle. It does its job well, but I think I prefer keeping my Kindle library limited to books only. Having a lot of bite-sized reading material on it seems like it will detract from the distraction-free experience I love so much.
