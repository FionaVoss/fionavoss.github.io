Now accepting and displaying [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) using [A WebMention Endpoint](https://webmention.herokuapp.com/) and [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/). If you reply to this post on Twitter or Micro.blog, it should show up on my site (but it might take a while). Hats off to [Pelle Wessman](https://voxpelli.com/) for building two essential pieces of infrastructure that power my site: first my [Micropub endpoint](https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github), now Webmentions.
