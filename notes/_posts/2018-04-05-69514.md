I listened to an interview recently with a man talking about his guide dog. He explained that if the dog does what it&#39;s trained to do, but not what he wants it to do at that moment, he always praises it before correcting. When he wants to use a different subway exit than usual, but dog tries to take him to the usual one: &quot;Good boy! *Find left.*&quot;

That&#39;s how I feel when I have to add custom inflections so Rails will let me use singular &#39;quota&#39; and plural &#39;quotas&#39; instead of plural &#39;quota&#39; and singular &#39;quotum&#39;.
