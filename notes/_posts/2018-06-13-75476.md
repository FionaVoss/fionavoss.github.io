One thing I do like about Twitter: I’ve noticed myself using “likes” as a polite way of ending an interaction. For example, if somebody replied to my post and I don’t have anything further to say, I might like their reply as a way of saying, “I read this and I appreciate it.” I wish Micro.blog had some feature that served this purpose, while still not showing a count of how many likes something got. I can reply with a 👍, but I hesitate to do that too often because I don’t want to clog up people’s timelines with 👍s.
