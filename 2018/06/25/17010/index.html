This kind of space is necessary. It’s vital. It’s human. Now imagine a child interacting with something called FaceMetrics, and its Read2Play app. Utilizing video working in concert with AI, FaceMetrics monitors the child’s behavior as they read, tracking eye movement to see how carefully or closely they might be reading, possibly saying, “You missed some paragraphs,” if it suspects skimming. It will reward children with game time if they read diligently. “Well done,” the app will tell children, “you read carefully, and you deserve another half an hour in the game.” 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬" />
