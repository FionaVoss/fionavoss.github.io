I'm a software engineer at [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/) in San Francisco.

I got my start in the industry at [LEARN Academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/)'s web development bootcamp, which I consider to be [one of the best educational experiences of my life]({% post_url /2018-09-18-best-educational-experiences %}).

Before that, I taught English as a second language to adult students from around the world in San Diego and New York City.

Right now I'm working on a second bachelor's degree in computer science from [Oregon State University](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students). [Read about why here.]({% post_url /2018-07-08-why-back-to-school-for-cs %})
