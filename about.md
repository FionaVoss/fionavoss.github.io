I'm a software developer based in San Diego, CA.

I work on lots of different things at [Ceatus Media Group](http://www.ceatus.com/) using Ruby on Rails.

I got my start in the industry at [LEARN Academy's web development bootcamp](https://www.learnacademy.org/).

Right now I'm working on a second bachelor's degree in computer science from [Oregon State University](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/online-cs-students).
