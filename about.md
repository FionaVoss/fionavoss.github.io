I'm a software engineer at [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/) in San Francisco.

I got my start in the industry at [LEARN Academy](https://www.learnacademy.org/)'s web development bootcamp, which I consider to be [one of the best educational experiences of my life]({% post_url /2018-09-18-best-educational-experiences %}).

Before that, I taught English as a second language to adult students from around the world in San Diego and New York City.

I maintain [We Pair](https://github.com/FionaVoss/we-pair), a crowd-sourced list of companies that pair program.
